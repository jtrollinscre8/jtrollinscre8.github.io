            <h2>Costume Projects</h2>
            <p>To me, Halloween is just another opportunity to make something cool. This has allowed me to try new techniques and make a variety of costumes, some of which are shown below.</p>

            <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, I had plenty of time at home to design and make my own costume. I've always loved dragons, so I used plastic tablecloths, popsicle sticks, cardboard, and paper to make this ice dragon. Tape and hot glue were the primary adhesives.</p>

            <h3>2022: Darth Vader</h3>

            <p>I really grew to love Star Wars around 2022, and I found a Darth Vader helmet project online. Cardboard has always been my go-to material, so this was a perfect design, and I decided to make it into a Halloween costume. The lightsaber was a modified 3D print for the hilt, with a flashlight inserted inside. Then I used a tube light protector for the blade, covered with colored basket wrap. </p>
            <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Cardboard-Darth-Vader-Helmet/">Here is the helmet design I used.</a>

            <p>Continuing with the Star Wars theme, I decided to become a Stormtrooper for 2023 Halloween. The helmet was made in a similar way to the Darth Vader helmet, with some admitted creative liberties, and I created the rest of the armor from cardboard, basing it on pictures and <span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gd9Z16FcpI">this video</a></span>. The gun was 3D printed from files from <span><a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1897849">this design</a></span> on Thingiverse. Overall, this was a very fun project to see come together.</p>
