            <h2>Vehicle Projects</h2>
            <p>I enjoy building many things, but even more so when it's something that can move. That's why I've become quite interested in mini vehicles.</p>

            <p>During the summer of 2021, I found out that it's possible to DIY a radio-controlled airplane out of cheap foam board, and I figured I'd try my hand. I spent a lot of time and a fair amount of money getting started and building my first airplane. Unfortunately, when I tried to take it off the ground, it didn't have enough lift, even at full speed. I was pretty bummed, and then the school year started, so I put away the project until later.</p>

            <p>The next summer, 2022, I decided I wanted to try again. This time I made the above airplane, designed by JoyplanesRC. It was quite a bit bigger, and I tried some different electronics. This time, I was able to get it off the ground! I wasn't a very good pilot yet, so that plane didn't last very long and went through multiple rounds of fixing, but I kept trying new plane designs and practicing flying. I found <a href="https://www.flitetest.com/">FliteTest</a>, a popular RC airplane group with many free designs available, and I had a blast building and flying them. I 3D printed various landing gear and created a few add-ons, such as a drop bay on the bottom. Here are a few more videos and pictures.</p>

            <p>In 2020, I did a lot of 3D printing projects while under COVID quarantine. One of those was this train project. It is based on the <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/groups/os-railway">OS Railway project</a> made by user Depronized on Thingiverse. I made a few different cars and spent most of my time on the engines. The suggested motor wasn't available very cheaply where I live, so I tried two different engine designs and various motor types and configurations. This really stretched my CAD skills and I learned a lot about Fusion360. My final working design was this big <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4390600">EMD GP38-39-inspired locomotive</a>. I adapted the electronics to respond to an IR remote control. My favorite use for this project was around the Christmas tree.</p>
