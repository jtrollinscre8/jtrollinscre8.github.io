            <p>I built this vivarium and another one like it for my crested gecko. I planned to get two geckos and breed them, which is why I made two, but that never happened. However, I really enjoyed these builds and making them come together with plants and animals. Having a small slice of the jungle in my bedroom has been a joy.</p>
