            <p>I built this vivarium and another one like it for my crested gecko. I planned to get two geckos and breed them, which is why I made two, but that never happened. However, I really enjoyed these builds and making them come together with plants and animals. Having a small slice of the jungle in my bedroom has been a joy.</p>

            <p>In the summer of 2020, we got a beareded dragon as our first family pet, and I was so intrigued that it was primarily me that took care of him. Eventually I decided he needed a bigger home, researched possible options, and learned I could make a naturalistic desert vivarium. So that's what I did.</p>

            <p>The summer before I moved to college, I asked my mother if I could make the jar in the corner of the counter &#40at that point a paludarium, explanation below&#41 into an aquarium with a little fish for her. She said yes, and I embarked on a quest to learn how to create a low-cost mini aquarium. The result is a little underwater world that houses an Endler's livebearer and a snail.</p>

            <p>Since I started making living mini ecosystems, I've made a variety of terrariums, as well as the paludarium below. A paludarium is a cross between a terrarium and an aquarium, so it has both land and water parts. This paludarium later became the aforementioned aquarium after I decided to get a fish. Shown are some pictures of a few terrariums that I've made.</p>
